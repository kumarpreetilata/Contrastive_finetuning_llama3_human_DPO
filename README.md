# Contrastive Fine-Tuning for LLaMA-3

## Overview
This project explores **contrastive fine-tuning** techniques combined with **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** to improve the LLaMA-3 model’s ability to follow instructions and generate high-quality responses aligned with human preferences.

## Key Concepts
- **Contrastive Learning:** Helps the model distinguish between high-quality and low-quality responses.
- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):** Enhances alignment with human-labeled preference data.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Uses optimization techniques to improve model performance without excessive computational costs.
- **Evaluation and Testing:** Measures model improvements through qualitative and quantitative assessments.

## Benefits
- **Better Alignment with User Intent:** The model generates responses that more closely match human expectations.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Fine-tuning methods reduce the need for extensive computational power.
- **Improved Context Awareness:** Enhances the model’s ability to follow instructions accurately.

## Applications
- Virtual assistants and AI chatbots
- Automated content moderation
- Personalized AI-generated responses
- Customer support automation

## Future Directions
- Expanding the dataset for broader generalization
- Improving multi-turn conversation understanding
- Enhancing real-time inference efficiency
